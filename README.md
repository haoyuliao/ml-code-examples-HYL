## Project 1: Detect AI vs. Human-Generated Images

**File:** `detect_ai_vs_human_generated_images_Colab.ipynb`  
**Platform:** Built and trained on **Google Colab**
**Competition Leaderboard:** [View on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/detect-ai-vs-human-generated-images/leaderboard) â€” Search *Howard Liao*  
**Description:**  
This notebook was developed for the **Detect AI vs. Human-Generated Images** competition on Kaggle. It features a PyTorch-based convolutional neural network trained on Google Colab to classify whether an image is AI-generated or human-created.

**Highlights:**
- The base model is **ConvNeXT**, which I fine-tuned by freezing its core layers and adding custom classification layers for binary prediction (i.e., real vs. fake).
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Training and evaluation loop
- Achieved Top 7% ranking (41st out of 554 participants)

## ðŸ“— Project 2: Generative AI Personal Finance Advisor

**File:** `genai-personal-finance-advisor.ipynb`  
**Platform:** Built and tested on **Kaggle Notebooks** 
**Link:** [View on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/haoyuliao14116/genai-personal-finance-advisor)
**Description:**  
This notebook is part of a GenAI Capstone project. It implements a generative AI agent using the **Gemini model** to analyze financial data and provide decision-making support for **buy**, **sell**, or **hold** actions.

**Highlights:**
- Integration of LLM for financial reasoning
- Prompt engineering and logic design
- Actions based on historical price trends
